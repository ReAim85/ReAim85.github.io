                    <p>JULY 10, 1856 BORN IN SMILJAN</p>
                   
                    <ul>
                        <li>Nikola Tesla is believed to have been born at midnight. During his birth, lightning struck during a summer storm. Born to a Serbian Family in Smiljan, Tesla was nicknamed `Child of the Storm`, by his aunt. That said, his mother replied to that comment by calling him `Child of the light`.</li>

                        1862 ENROLLS IN 
                        FIRST GRADE OF ELEMENTARY SCHOOL IN SMILJAN <br>

                        1863 MOVES WITH FAMILY TO GOSPIC <br>

                        1863-1870 COMPLETES ELEMENTARY SCHOOL AND LOWER TECHNICAL SCHOOL IN GOSPIC</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Completed four years of elementary school in 1867 as an excellent pupil, and his name was entered in the school’s “Golden Book”.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>1874 BRUSH WITH DEATH</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Despite his father's demand that he not return to Gospic, where a cholera epidemic was raging, on graduating he returned home and become seriously ill. He would remain in bed for a full nine months.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>1875 ENROLLS IN COLLAGE</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>In 1875, Tesla enrolled to a Polytechnic based on a military scholarship. He was a disciplined student and achieved the highest grades possible while passing various exams. More so, he also started a cultural club and received a letter of commendation from the dean of the Technical Department. During his second year, he got into an argument with one his professors over the functionality of the Gramme dynamo.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>1878 MATICA SRPSKA IN NOVI SAD REJECTS APPLICATION FOR STIPENDIUM</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Matica Srpska had already rejected his first application, submitted on October 14, 1876. In his new application to the “celebrated Matica Srpska”, he asked for a stipendium to complete “engineering studies” in Vienna or Prague, but was refused a second time. Apparently he did not regard this as a slight from the oldest and most highly-regarded Serbian cultural, literary and scientific institution because, as a world-famous scientist, he became a member in 1902.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>1878-1879 FIRST EMPLOYMENT IN MARIBOR</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Worked in a local technical company. Having insufficient funds to support himself, he was expelled by the city administration on March 8 for not having an residence permit and returned to Gospic under police escort.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>1880 STUDIES NATURAL PHILOSOPHY AT THE CHARLES UNIVERSITY IN PRAGUE</p>
                        
                        <ul>
                            <li>Tesla’s uncle collected money to help him relocate to Prague to finish his studies. He arrived late to enroll for classes, and his lack of competence in Greek and Czech meant that he did not qualify for the classes he wanted to take. Instead, he took up classes in Philosophy at the university, though he did not receive grades for the courses.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>1881 EMPLOYED AS ENGINEER IN BUDAPEST</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Thanks to family friend Ferenc Puskas, who was working with his brother Tivadar on installing the first telephone exchange in Budapest, Tesla obtained employment as a “chief electrician” in the Central Telephone Office. Here he built his first invention, a device for voice amplification on the telephone.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>1882 INVENTION OF THE ROTATING MAGNETIC FIELD</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Walking with his friend Anton Szigety in the Budapest City Park, watching the setting sun and reciting verses from Goethe’s “Faust”, he discovered the principle of creating a rotating magnetic field with alternating current.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>1882 EMLOYED BY CONTINENTAL EDISON IN PARIS</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>In 1882, he found another job in Paris with a company referred to as the Continental Edison Company. He began working in a new industry by installing indoor lighting resources. His company had several divisions, and he worked in the section of the company that was responsible for lighting systems. At this company, he improved his electrical engineering prowess. The management team noticed his abilities and soon introduced him as part of the team that would produce dynamos and motors. Following this, Tesla moved to New York in the USA. In 1884, one of his managers from Paris was relocated to the US to manage a company where he worked. During, this time, Tesla started a manufacturing division that was found in New York and sought for Tesla to be relocated to the country as well. In the same year, Tesla was relocated to the USA and started working immediately.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>1885 FIRST PATENTS</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>In March 1885, he met with an attorney known as Lemuel Serrel, to help in the submission of various patents. Serrel introduced Tesla to various businessmen, including Benjamin Vail and Robert Lane. They agreed to help finance a new light production company, Tesla Electric Light and Manufacturing Company,  under Tesla Name. Tesla worked to acquire the patents for the company including developing an enhanced DC motor. His solutions gained attention from the mass media who sought his solutions.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>1887 RE-IMAGINES THE ELECTRIC MOTOR</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>In 1887, Tesla came up with an induction motor that was operated by alternating current, a form of power that was becoming common in Europe and the USA. This type of power provided various benefits, especially in long-distance power transmission. In particular, the motor was operated by a polyphase current, which produced a rotating magnetic field to operate the motor. This innovative electric motor was patented in May 1988, and it comprised of a basic self-starting design that did not require the use of commutators. As a result, this reduced the occurrence of sparking the high maintenance that was associated with replacing mechanical brushes. From 1888-1891 he secured a total of 36 patents which allowed him to completely develop what was known as the Tesla Polyphase System, and created the basis for the second industrial revolution.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>1890 BEGINS HIS WORK ON WIRELESS POWER TRANSMISSION</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>After 1890, Tesla researched various approaches to transmitting power by inductive and capacitive coupling. This was through the use of AC voltages that were produced by his famous `Tesla coil.` He tried in many ways to come up with a wireless lighting system that was based on near field and capacitative coupling. He even performed various public demonstrations, where he would light up Geissler tubes to impress his audience. Tesla also spent close to well over a decade trying to come up with new solutions for lighting</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>1891 PATENTS THE TESL COIL</p>

                        <ul> 
                            <li>Patent no. 454.622 for this new device was granted on June 23. Today it is known throughout the world as the Tesla Coil. On july 30 he was granted American citizenship</li>
                      </ul>

                      <p>1892 LECTURES IN LONDON AND PARIS AND VISITS BIRTHPLACE FOR THE LAST TIME</p>
                      
                      <ul>
                        <li>On February 3, at the Royal Society in London, Tesla gave a lecture entitled “Experiments with Alternate Current of High Potential and High Frequency”. Present were the most significant scientific figures of that time, including William Crookes, James Dewar, J.J. Thomson and many others. He would repeat this lecture in Paris on February 19, before members of the Société Française de Physique and the International Association of Electrical Engineers. Learning that his mother was close to death, he arrived in Gospic on April 15, just in time to say goodbye to the person he loved most of all.</li>
                      </ul>

                      <p>1895 TESLA'S LABORATORY BURNS DOWN</p>
                      
                      <ul>
                        <li>On March 14, a major fire burst out in 35 Fifth Avenue where Tesla’s laboratory was located. It destroyed all his machine prototypes, hundreds of light bulbs of his original design, books, letters and valuable technical documentation.</li>
                      </ul>

                      <p>1896 WORLD’S FIRST HYDROELECTRIC PLANT, BASED ON TESLA’S PATENTS, BEGINS OPERATION <br>

                    </p>

                    <p>1899 EXPERIMENTS IN COLORADO SPRINGS</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>He went to Colorado Springs on May 18 intending, as he put it, “to construct a high-frequency generator of great power, to perfect a method for the individualization and mutual isolation of the transmitted energy and to determine the laws governing the transmission of power through the earth and the atmosphere”. From June 1, 1899, to January 7, 1900, his collected research notes contain various recorded values and calculations, many diagrams, remarks or comments on the daily experiments and the use of new configurations of instruments, apparatus and the connections between them.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>1901-1902 BUILDS LABORATORY WITH TRANSMISSION TOWER ON LONG ISLAND</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Construction of the laboratory and tower for his World System of Wireless Transmission began in 1901, designed by the renowned American architect Stanford White. It was completed in 1902, although the tower, as originally envisaged, was never finished. According to Tesla’s plan, signals from the transmission tower would be sent wirelessly through the Earth, which is a conducting body, and received anywhere on Earth.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>1903-1906 UNSUCCESSFUL ATTEMPTS TO COMPLETE THE WORLD SYSTEM</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>The great business magnate and financier of this project, John Pierpont Morgan, withdrew from further investment. Tesla wrote him many letters attempting to persuade him to continue investment in the project, but without success. He would finally leave Long Island in 1906 and turn to research and inventions in mechanical engineering.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>April 18, 1905 PATENTS “ART OF TRANSMITTING ELECTRICAL ENERGY THROUGH THE NATURAL MEDIUMS”</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>He had applied for this patent, no. 787,412, five years earlier, on May 16, 1900. In it he described the concept of “stationary waves”, which he found to have wavelengths of from 25 to 70 kilometers. From his own research he concluded that waves of this kind could propagate through the earth in all directions. Tesla’s intention was to confirm the idea of the resonance of the planet. He expected that these resonances would be 6, 18 and 30 Hz.</li>

                        <li>In the article “Some Personal Recollections”, published in Scientific American on June 5, Tesla spoke for the first time about his life and his inventions, especially his wonderful discovery of the rotating magnetic field in Budapest in 1892.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>1916 SELLS LICENSE FOR SPEEDOMETER PATENT</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>The license was bought by the Boston company Waltham Watch, one of the largest American companies making precision instruments, watches and speedometers. According to Tesla’s documentation, the company sold about 60,000 speedometers, mostly built into mass-manufactured vehicles.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>May 18, 1917 AWARDED THE GOLD EDISON MEDAL</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>The medal, awarded by the American Institute of Electrical Engineers, was created in 1904. It was awarded to Tesla on December 13, 1916, for his discoveries in the field of polyphase and high-frequency currents. It was formally presented at a ceremony at the American Institute of Electrical Engineers on May 18, 1917.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>1919 PUBLISHES “MY INVENTIONS”</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>He published his famous autobiography “My Inventions” in six instalments in the well-known popular scientific magazine Electrical Experimenter. The magazine was founded and edited by his friend and great admirer, the inventor Hugo Gernsback (1884-1967).</li>

                    </p>

                    <p>1928 FINAL PATENT</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>In his 72nd year he was granted his final patent for “Apparatus for Aerial Transportation”. He was the first to imagine a flying machine with vertical take-off and landing, a combination of helicopter and fixed-wing which would be powered by his turbines.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>1934-1941 PROPOSES PROJECTS IN TELEGEODYNAMICS</p>
                
                    <ul>
                        <li>Tesla used the newly-coined term “telegeodynamics” to describe a technology for transmitting energy mechanically through the earth. He offered his mechanical oscillators and transmission and receiving apparatus to renowned American companies such as Texas, Westinghouse and Buffalo. These devices could be used to transmit signals and messages through the earth in navigation and industry and for the production of various revolutionary effects.</li>
                    </ul>
                     
                    <p>1935-1938 TESLA'S SECRET WEAPON</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>On April 20, 1935, Tesla signed a contract with the Soviet trade representatives in New York, the Armtorg Trading Corporation. It dealt with protecting the Soviet Union from enemy aggression by building an impenetrable wall created by a new weapon. In this contract he undertook to, within a deadline of four months, submit a detailed project with drawings of installations which could generate a potential of 50 million volts, fire a beam of concentrated particles at a distance of at least 150 kilometers, with a maximum velocity of at least 50 kilometers a second, and produce devastating effects at the target.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>1942 MEETS KING PETAR II KARAÐORÐEVIC IN THE NEW YORKER HOTEL</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>King Petar II Karadordevic came to Washington that year to visit the American President. Because he wanted to meet Tesla, he travelled on to New York and met with the great scientist in his apartment in the New Yorker Hotel. The young king wrote later in his diary that Tesla’s words were very touching and that both of them wept.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>January 7, 1943 NIKOLA TESLA DIES AT 86</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Tesla died in his sleep, in his apartment on the 33rd floor of the New Yorker Hotel, where he had spent the last nine years of his life. A memorial service was held on January 10, broadcast live by Radio New York. New York Mayor Fiorello La Guardia read the eulogy, which was written by Louis Adamic, the Slovenian writer, essayist and translator. Croatian violinist Zlatko Balokovic and the Sloven choir performed the Serbian patriotic song “Tamo daleko” (Far Away) at the memorial. The Royal Yugoslav Government Information Centre organized the ceremony of Tesla’s funeral and published an announcement about the protocol for it. Tesla’s remains lay in the Frank E. Campbell Funeral Home. The funeral service was held on January 12, at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine. A delegation of thirty Yugoslav officers contributed to the ceremony. Nikola Tesla was interred in the Ferncliff Cemetery in Hartsdale on January 12, 1943. Two and a half months after his death, on March 25, 1943, at the request of Sava Kosanovic,
                            the remains of Nikola Tesla were cremated</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>1960 HIGHEST RECOGNITION OF NIKOLA TESLA</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>In 1960, Nikola Tesla’s immeasurable contribution to science was recognized. The 11th General Conference on Weights and Measures, held in Paris from October 11 to 20, 1960, passed a resolution naming the unit of magnetic induction in the International System of Units (Si system) the “tesla”. Thus Tesla joined fifteen of the greatest scientific giants, such as Newton, Faraday, Volta, Hertz, Ampère and Kelvin, and took his place in the temple of science for all time.</li>

                <h2>Alternating Current</h2>
                <p>This is one of his first ever inventions that caused a stir at the 1893 Worlds Fair in Chicago. The resulting conclusion from Edison and Tesla`s argument on the distribution and production of electricity was provided. The argument could be summarized in relation to cost and safety factors. It was determined that the DC current produced by Edison was costly over long distances and it also produced sparks from the commutator. Edison and his proponents used various approaches to oppose Tesla`s Alternative Current as a solution. Edison tried to prove by going as far as electrocuting animals to prove his point. That said, Tesla responded by showing that AC was safe by shooting current through his body to produce light. This argument is regarded by most as the culmination of well over a decade of wrangles in terms of patents, corrupt deals and stolen ideas. Despite it all, this proves that the system developed by Tesla is effective at providing power in the modern era.</p>

                <h2>Modern Lighting</h2>
                <p>While Tesla did not invent light itself, he is responsible for the innovations that have been crucial in how it’s distributed and produced. He came up with fluorescent bulbs in his lab 40 years before they became a standard in the consumer market. More so, at the world`s fair, he used glass tubes by customizing them into the names of famous scientists, to create neon signs.</p>

                <h2>X-rays</h2>
                <p>Ionizing radio and electromagnetic technologies were common on research during early in the 1800s. However, Nikola Tesla went in depth by studying everything up until the Kirlian photography. This resource has the ability to observe life force, which is now common in medical diagnostics. It was a transformative piece of technology which Tesla was key in it`s development. Similar to many of his inventions, the inspiration for X-rays came from his belief that everything we need, is around us at all times.</p>
                
                <h2>Radio</h2>
                <p>It’s important to note that the Guglielmo Marconi is initially credited to be the inventor of the original radio technology. However, the Supreme Court denied his patent in 1943, when it was determined that Tesla originally built the radio years before. In particular, Radio signals occur naturally and require a transmitter and receiver to be used. This is a technique that Tesla demonstrated at a presentation in 1892 before the National Electric Light Association. Five years later, Tesla made a patent application. However, in 1904, the patents were overturned with the U.S patent office determining that Marconi was the original owner. This was mainly due to the backing that Marconi had and the state, which was afraid of paying royalties to Tesla</p>

                <h2>Remote Control</h2>
                <p>This particular invention was a natural development from the radio. The demonstration of this technology occurred in 1898 and it comprised of several huge batteries. Also, the demonstration included large radio controlled switches, a rudder, running light and a boat propeller. Although this technology remained dormant for a long time, it has played an important role in modern day society.</p>

                <h2>Electric Motor</h2>
                <p>One of his greatest inventions has finally become popular by the car that brandishes his name. Although the technical aspects are beyond the scope of this summary, it is important to note that the invention of the motor was one Tesla`s exceptional inventions. In fact, the development of this motor could have helped in reducing the world`s dependency on oil. That said, this invention was compromised by the economic crisis in 1930 and the following world wars. All things considered, this technology has revolutionized the world in many ways.</p>

                <h2>Robotics</h2>
                <p>With his exceptional prowess in scientific concepts, Nikola Tesla came up with the idea that all people are inspired by external impulses. In fact, according to him, every thought and act, was inspired by external stimuli. As a result, he came up with the concept of robotics. That said, an aspect of humanity was still present, with Tesla claiming the human replicas have limitations including growth and procreation. Nevertheless, Tesla worked with all his information to come up with practical solutions. Some of his visions for the future including robotic companions, use of sensors, autonomous systems and intelligent vehicles.</p>
                
                <h2>Lasers</h2>
                <p>Tesla is also believed to have played a major role in the invention of the laser. Lasers have played an important role in various medical procedures such as surgery. Besides that, the laser has also been key in the development of digital media. That said, his invention of the laser is a classical example of crossing into the worlds of science fiction. The main paradox here being that laser energy can be beneficial for the society and potentially dangerous at the same time. Lasers are still evolving and most techniques are based on the research by Tesla.</p>

                <h2>Wireless Communications and Limitless Free Energy</h2>
                <p>These two technologies are directly linked and they can have a significant impact in our daily lives. J.P Morgan gave Tesla the funding to develop a technology that would leverage the occurrence of natural frequencies in the universe to transmit data. This includes a broad range of information that could be communicated including voice messages, text and images. This represented the world’s first communication resources, but it also showed that there was a worldwide technology that could be used to connect the entire world.</p>

                <h2>Long-Range Wireless Energy Transfer</h2>
                <p style="margin-right: 180px;">Tesla was researching how energy could be transferred wireless by using his accumulated knowledge on microwaves and radio. This also involved the creation of the Tesla Coil and magnifying transmitter. Tesla wanted to come up with a system where energy could be transmitted through long distances. To achieve this goal, he developed the Wardenclyffe Tower in Shoreham, Long Island. The role of this island was to function as wireless telecommunications resources and transmit electrical power. That said, JP Morgan who funded the development of the tower finally cut down the funding for the same. Since he was unable to find any additional financiers, he was inclined to stop the development of the tower. As a result, he was never able to achieve his goal of transmitting energy worldwide.</p>

                <h2>Death Ray</h2>
                <p>Early in the 1930s, Tesla claimed to have come with a particle beam weapon. Theoretically speaking, this device would have been able of producing an intense and focused beam of energy. This energy could be sent across great distances to destroy armies, warplanes and more. Tesla advertised his technologies to various militaries all over the world, but never found the best financiers. According to Tesla, efforts had been made to steal the invention. His room was invaded, and his papers were scrutinized, but the perpetrators never found anything worth value.</p>

                <h2>Tesla’s Oscillator</h2>
                <p style="margin-right:180px ;">In 1898, Tesla claimed to have developed and launched a small oscillating device that, when attached to a building, would shake it almost destroying everything around it. This device could essentially produce the same power as an earthquake. Upon realizing the potential side effects of owning such a technology, he informed his staff to destroy the technology. Some theorists still believe that the government continues to use his research in places such as the HAARP facility.</p>

                <h2>Free Electricity System</h2>
                <p>With financing from J.P Morgan, Tesla developed the Wardenclyffe Tower. This was a gigantic wireless transmission station that was found in New York in the early nineties. Morgan believed the Tower could transmit wireless resources all over the world. That said, Tesla had other plans. He intended to send messages, images and telephony all across the Atlantic to the UK. This would even be related to ships at sea based on his concepts of leveraging the Earth to conduct signals. If the project was successful, anyone could gain access to electricity, by simply inserting a rode into the ground. That said, free electricity is not profitable. This system could have serious ramifications for the energy supply in the world and Morgan refused to finance it.</p>

                <h2>Improved Airships</h2>
                <p>Tesla proposed that ships which were electrically powered could help in transporting passengers from New York to London in less than 4 hours. The airships would travel eight miles above the ground, and he also believed that the airships might source their power from the atmosphere. This would reduce the need to refuel, and the ships might be used to transport passengers to pre-chosen locations. He was never validated for his invention, and we nowadays have drones flying based on his work as inspiration.</p>
